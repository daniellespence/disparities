Overview
--------

The code in this replication package uses R to construct all analyses in *Disparities in economic values for nature-based activities in Canada*. The data is from the Canadian Nature Survey (2012). Additional information on the dataset is provided in Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Governments of Canada (2014). Raw data were cleaned and travel costs calculated for the publication *Economic Benefits of Recreation in Canada*. Code for data preparation and calculation of travel costs are available at https://github.com/plloydsmith/RecBenefitsCanadaCJE. Here, one master file runs all of the code to generate the data for the 2 figures in the paper. The replicator should expect the code to run for about 48 hours. All other scripts are available at https://github.com/daniellespence/disparities

### Details on each Data Source

Data on Canadian recreation behaviour were downloaded from the Government of Canada's Open Data portal. Raw data can be downloaded from https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/694b9da8-1f06-4ebe-ad38-1b14bdaf756e, under the Resource Name "cns2012pumf.xlsx" and Resource Type Dataset. The data dictionary is also provided at this link. A copy of the data is provided as part of this archive. The data are in the public domain.

Data were prepared using the '1PrepareData.R' script available at https://github.com/plloydsmith/RecBenefitsCanadaCJE

Datafile used:  `CanadaRecData.csv`
